\chapter{Concept}

The idea for a flag-based encyclopedia and quiz app came about from a fascination with flag designs. Over the years I have come across many websites offering information about flags and their origins. However, most of these websites are relatively old and not a mobile-friendly responsive website, usually with unreadable text on mobile devices. This project aims to fill the gap and provide a mobile-friendly solution.
