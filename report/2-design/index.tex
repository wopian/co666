\section{Initial Mockup}

Before implementation of the mobile application began, concept designs were drawn free-hand on paper. These mockup designs were then digitised with the use of the open-source prototyping tool Pencil. \cite{Pencil}

In the designs, the flags are grouped and categorised in decending order of scale, deciding to split the flags by continents/landmasses providing an initial six categories to filter by on the initial screen when a user will open the app.

(Figure \ref{fig:2a5}, pp \pageref{fig:2a5})

When a user taps on one of the continent cards they will be shown a list of flags. The list of flags would be sorted alphabetically and display the flag in the correct aspec ratio (proportion) of the flag at a thumbnail size - something several flag sites this project took inspiration from often lack. While designing the mockups I had the idea of using the official name of the flag to go alongside the flag graphic, however this was reconsidered in later designs and eventually became the country the flag is from.

(Figure \ref{fig:2a1}, pp \pageref{fig:2a1})

Tapping on the flag or country from the prior list would bring the user to the flag details view. This view would show the flag and various details related to it, such as it's name, proportion, when the flag was adopted among others that hadn't yet been decided at this early stage of design.

(Figure \ref{fig:2a4}, pp \pageref{fig:2a4})

From there, users would be able to swipe to a similar view as the country flag lists, but for flags of the countries' subdivisions - counties, states, prefectures. Navigating to these pages would show a similar view as the country flag details but would not provide further depth, for example towns and city flags.

Finally, two quiz sections were designed. One of these would sit at the top level of navigation and provide quiz questions from all of the flags available in the application, accessible from the bottom navigation bar. The second quiz section would be restricted to questions about a single country's flag and or it's subdivision flags. A point would be awarded for each correct answer and the users' results displayed after a certain number of questions are answered. Questions would be in set of different formats, such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A text-based question with text-based answers - for example, asking the name of the country containing a specific number of colours);
  \item A text and image-based question with text-based answers - for example, asking the name of the pictured flag's country or flag name);
  \item A text-based question with image-based answers - for example, asking which of the following is the flag of a named country.
\end{itemize}

\section{Prototype}

Next, a series of prototypes were designed to visualise how it would look with Android's user interface theming applied.
